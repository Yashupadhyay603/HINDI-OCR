# HINDI-OCR

This is a simple implementation of Hindi OCR using CNN model trained using Tensorflow and Keras libraries.

Image preprocessing and segmentation is solely done using OpenCV for most of the hindi words model give proper prediction.

- For training the model I have used Devanagari Character Set from Kaggle [click here](https://www.kaggle.com/rishianand/devanagari-character-set)
